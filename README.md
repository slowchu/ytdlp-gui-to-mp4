# ytdlp-gui-to-mp4

A lightweight, open-source graphical interface for downloading and converting videos from supported platforms using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).

Designed to make downloading and converting videos simple, fast, and Discord-friendly — no terminal needed.

### Strongly suggest running the [batchfile](https://github.com/slowchu/ytdlp-gui-to-mp4/releases/download/v1.0/install-tools.bat) to install FFMPEG and yt-dlp automatically for easiest compatibility

[Release v1.5.1](https://github.com/slowchu/ytdlp-gui-to-mp4/releases/tag/v1.5.1)
- More file-size estimate tweaks/tuning
- Final update with file-size estimate, next update will be a streamlined version with no file-size estimate (too much of a headache to deal with since it estimates without downloading the raw file to be converted. Perhaps at some point I might put out a version where the program will download the raw file first to get a better estimate, but for now I'm going to move forward with versions that don't have this feature since its been too inaccurate depending on videos chosen and has caused me to spend way too much time trying to tune a rather unimportant feature. If discord optimized outputs are still too large then there isn't much you can do without outright editing your desired video yourself)

## ✅ Features

- Paste any yt-dlp supported video platform URL 
- Choose your output filename
- Adjust video quality using an intuitive slider and resolution drop down
- “Discord Optimized” mode, attempts to output at low settings in an attempt to optimize size for non-nitro file limits/mobile usage:
  - 720p max resolution
  - CRF 28 for size reduction
  - 96kbps audio
- MP4 output (H.264 + 128k or 96k AAC)
- Saves files to your system's `Videos/YT-DLP Downloads` folder
- Filesize estimator
- Clean GUI, no terminal required

## 📦 Requirements (if running from .py source)

- Python 3.7 or later
- `yt-dlp` installed (`yt-dlp.exe` must be in the same folder or system PATH)
- `ffmpeg` installed (`ffmpeg.exe` must be in the same folder or system PATH)


## ⚙️ Optional: Setup Script (`install-tools.bat`)

This project includes a helpful batch script: `install-tools.bat`

### 🔧 What It Does:
- Downloads the latest versions of:
  - [yt-dlp.exe](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
  - [ffmpeg.exe](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)
- Adds both tools to your system `PATH`
  - This allows you to run `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` from anywhere
- Sets everything up so the GUI works out of the box

### 📌 When to Use It:
- If the GUI doesn’t work because `yt-dlp` or `ffmpeg` is missing

### 🛠 How to Use:
1. Right-click the file `install-tools.bat`
2. Choose **Run as Administrator**
3. Wait for it to finish downloading and updating your system

> 💡 You may need to restart your terminal or PC after running it for PATH changes to apply.
